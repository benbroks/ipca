Using h5py and sklearn to instantiate and compress a large matrix in small batches. Should be used for files that are too large for memory but small enough for disk. Allows users to configure matrix dimensions, instantiation batch size, compression batch size, and provides a template for array instantiation (currently generates random floats).
